## Description
### _This allows practice one-to-many relationships, databases, Active Record and rails._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Using your terminal you can git clone this project to your desktop.

* https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/ruby/getting-started-with-ruby/installing-ruby to see Ruby setup and Installation instructions if you don't currently have it installed.

* Then you will call the directory using your terminal, make sure you're in the desktop and cd "project name here"

* Run "bundle install" in your terminal after opening the project. This will install neccessary gems.

* Run rails s in your terminal. If successful you can open your browser and type in localhost:3000 to run the app.




* It's a lot more files that I'm used to dealing with. If it seems overwhelming just know that you can simply look at most of the necessary code in the app folder on github.






_This project uses the latest versions of Ruby, rails and the Gems included in the project._
